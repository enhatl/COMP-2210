# Recursive Summation

In the starter code `Summation.java` you are provided with the method `sumI()`
that computes the summation of the integers from 1 to `n` inclusive using
*iteration*. You are to complete the body of the `sumR()` method so that it also
computes the sum of the integers from 1 to `n`, but you must use **recursion**.
